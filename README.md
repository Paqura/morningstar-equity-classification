Morningstar Equity Classification System Map (MECS)
==================================================

This library just aims to enable lookups in the reference table of Morningstar as published on their [website](http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/methodologydocuments/methodologypapers/equityclassmethodology.pdf) in an easy way by build a Node module containing a JSON map and some methods.

## Installation

```shell
npm install morningstar-equity-classification
```

## Usage

```javascript
MECS = require('morningstar-equity-classification');

MECS.all()
//=> [ { code: 926150 }... ]

MECS.search('coffee');
//=> [ { code: 926150 }... ]

MECS.find('926150');
//=> { code: 926150 }

MECS.above('926150');
//=> [ { code: 92615 }, { code: 9261 }, { code: 926 }, { code: 92 }... ]

MECS.below('9261');
//=> [ { code: 92615 }, { code: 926150 }... ]
```

## Dataset Indexing

In order to enable keyword-based searches on the MECS dataset, we use a reverse index stored in ``/data/data-index.json``. The index is generated by tokenizing relevant properties on MECS classifications and storing them in an index object keyed by the tokenized text. The index relates keywords to scores that represent the likelihood that a specific keyword is related to a MECS classification.

In order to rebuild the index run the following command from the project directory:

```shell
$ ./bin/build-index
```
